# HtmlUtilities.ToUrlSlug method

Generates a "url slug" from the specified value that can be used as a HTML id in a Markdown document.

```csharp
public static string ToUrlSlug(string? value)
```

## Remarks

This method can be used to generate a id for linking within a document (typically a link to a heading).

There is no official spec for how anchors for headings work. This implementation follows the guidance from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27981247/github-markdown-same-page-link):

* Leading and trailing whitespace is dropped.
* Punctuation marks are dropped.
* Upper case letters are converted to lower case.
* Spaces are replaced with `-`
