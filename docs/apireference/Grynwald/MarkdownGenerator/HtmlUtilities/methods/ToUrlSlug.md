# HtmlUtilities.ToUrlSlug Method

**Declaring Type:** [HtmlUtilities](../index.md)

Generates a "url slug" from the specified value that can be used as a HTML id in a Markdown document.

public static string ToUrlSlug(string value);
```

- Leading and trailing whitespace is dropped.
- Punctuation marks are dropped.
- Upper case letters are converted to lower case.
- Spaces are replaced with `-`
